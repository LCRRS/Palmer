This research project examines the physical, mathematical and programming aspects of constructing an autonomous quadcopter at a minimal budget. Open-source software was used in creation of flight and stabilization algorithms. The Arduino microcontroller was implemented as primary means for bidirectional communication with the periphery devices. C++ language compatibility allowed for the fast execution necessary to process the mathematical functions involved in the two-axis stabilization of a multirotor. The precision of the stabilization algorithm was achieved by studying the mathematical principles of control feedback loops and implementing the Proportionality Integral Derivative (PID) controller. Part of the automation algorithm was achieved using a RaspberryPi microcomputer as a platform to perform the image-processing, allowing the system to rely on the video input to navigate itself in space. The image-processing functionality was implemented using the OpenCV module for Python. The designed system was configured to be responsive to changes in both hardware and software components, which allows for additional research of specific algorithms to be done with minimal effect on the work flow of other elements. We believe that the multirotor constructed in this research will serve as an effective tool in studying the direct hardware communication in advanced robotic systems.
