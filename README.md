Palmer is a code name for a project led by the members of the Luther College Robotics Research Society.

ï»¿This research examines the physical, mathematical and programming aspects of constructing an autonomous multirotor control. Open-source software was used in creation of algorithms responsible for flight and stabilization. This, paired with cost-effective hardware choices, allowed us to create our quadcopter with a minimal budget. Arduino microcontroller was implemented as a primary device for bidirectional communication with the periphery devices, including the main rotors and the combination of a gyroscope and an accelerometer. C++ language compatibility allowed for the fast execution necessary to process the mathematical functions involved in the two-axis stabilization of a multirotor. Part of the automation algorithm was achieved using a RaspberryPi microcomputer as a platform to perform the image-processing, allowing the system to rely on the video input to navigate itself in space. The image-processing functionality is implemented using the OpenCV module for Python. One of the methods utilized for writing the stabilization algorithm is the Proportionality Integral Derivative (PID) controller.  In order to achieve the level of precision in the stabilization of the multirotor, we study the theoretical physical concepts involved in the forces acting upon the system. The designed system was configured to be responsive to changes in both hardware and software components, which allows for additional research of specific algorithms to be done with minimal effect on the work flow of other elements. We believe that the multirotor constructed in this research will serve as an effective tool in studying the direct hardware communication in advanced robotic systems.
